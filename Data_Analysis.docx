This Python program demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline involving synthetic data generation, statistical analysis, and data visualization using the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. The objective of the script is to simulate a retail environment and extract actionable insights from customer purchasing behavior.
1. Data Generation and Management
The script begins by generating a synthetic dataset of 500 records. Using NumPy’s random sampling, it creates realistic variables including CustomerID, Age, and ProductCategory. Notably, the PurchaseAmount is modeled using an exponential distribution, reflecting real-world retail patterns where many small transactions occur alongside fewer high-value purchases. This data is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame and exported to a CSV file for persistence.
2. Statistical Profiling
The analysis phase employs descriptive and segmented statistics to understand the data's distribution:
Initial Inspection: The script uses .info() and .head() to verify data integrity and schema.
Descriptive Statistics: A global summary provides the mean and standard deviation for age and spending.
Segmented Analysis: The program utilizes the .groupby() function to calculate the Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation of purchases specifically for each product category (Electronics, Clothing, Furniture, and Toys).
3. Visual Analytics
To conclude the pipeline, the script generates two primary visualizations:
Distribution Analysis: A histogram illustrates the frequency of purchase amounts, confirming the skewness of the exponential distribution.
Comparative Analysis: A bar chart displays the total revenue generated by each category, allowing for a quick visual comparison of sales performance.
Overall, the program serves as a robust template for automated retail reporting and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
