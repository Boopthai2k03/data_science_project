This program generates and analyzes a synthetic transaction dataset for 500 records, simulating real-world e-commerce behavior while including all required columns: TransactionID, PurchaseAmount, CustomerAge, ProductCategory, TimeSpentMinutes, IsReturned, and TransactionDate. The dataset captures key transaction characteristics such as purchase amounts, customer age, product categories, and return behavior.
Data Generation:

PurchaseAmount is generated using an exponential distribution to simulate real-world skewness in spending, where most purchases are moderate but a few are high-value.

CustomerAge is randomly assigned between 18 and 70 years.

ProductCategory is randomly selected among Electronics, Clothing, Furniture, and Toys.

IsReturned is a binary variable representing whether a product was returned.

TransactionDate spans 500 consecutive days starting from 2025-01-01.

Analysis Performed:

Descriptive Statistics: The program calculates key summary metrics for PurchaseAmount (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, etc.), providing insight into the central tendency and variability of transactions.

Histogram: Visualizes the distribution of PurchaseAmount, confirming the right-skewed nature of purchase values.

Bar Chart: Displays the frequency of transactions across different ProductCategory values, highlighting the most popular product categories.

Box Plot: Compares PurchaseAmount across product categories, identifying variations and potential outliers in spending patterns.

Frequency Distribution: Prints the counts of each ProductCategory to understand the categorical distribution.

Key Findings:

Electronics and Clothing are the most frequently purchased categories, as seen in both the bar chart and frequency table.

Purchase amounts are heavily skewed, with occasional high-value transactions significantly impacting the mean.

Box plots reveal that Furniture and Electronics purchases have higher variability and some outliers compared to Clothing and Toys.

This program successfully combines data generation, descriptive statistics, and visualizations to provide a clear understanding of customer transactions, product popularity, and spending patterns in a synthetic e-commerce dataset.
