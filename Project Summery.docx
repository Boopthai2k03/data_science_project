Analyzing Simulated E-commerce Customer
Behavior

Introduction:
In the digital era, e-commerce platforms generate vast amounts of customer interaction data.
Analyzing such data helps businesses understand customer preferences, optimize website
performance, and improve sales strategies. However, due to privacy and security concerns, real
customer data cannot always be shared. This project addresses that challenge by using a
simulated dataset to demonstrate core data science techniques. The focus is on understanding
customer behavior through basic statistical analysis and visualization, forming a strong foundation
for advanced analytical and machine learning tasks.

Project Overview:
This project analyzes simulated e-commerce customer behavior using Python. A synthetic dataset
was generated to represent customer demographics and purchasing patterns. The workflow
includes data generation, integrity checks, descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, and
correlation analysis to extract meaningful insights.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains 500 customer records with four attributes: CustomerID, Age (18–70 years),
TimeSpentMinutes (1–60 minutes spent on the website), and PurchaseAmountUSD (ranging from
10 to 500 USD). The dataset was stored in Excel format for easy accessibility and reuse.

Analysis Performed:
The analysis includes data integrity checks to confirm the absence of missing values, followed by
the computation of descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.
Visual exploration was carried out using a histogram for purchase amount distribution and a scatter
plot to examine the relationship between time spent and purchase amount.

Correlation Analysis:
The Pearson correlation coefficient between TimeSpentMinutes and PurchaseAmountUSD was
calculated to measure the strength and direction of their relationship. This metric helps assess
whether increased user engagement on the website is associated with higher spending.

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the use of synthetic data to perform fundamental data
science tasks in an e-commerce context. The analysis provides insights into customer spending
patterns and their interaction with website engagement time. While the dataset is simulated, the
workflow closely mirrors real-world analytical processes. The findings highlight the importance of
data preparation, exploratory analysis, and interpretation before applying advanced modeling
techniques. This project serves as a strong foundation for future work involving predictive analytics
and customer behavior modeling.
