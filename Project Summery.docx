This program was designed to resolve the previously identified issues related to missing textual deliverables and incomplete interpretation of analytical results. The dataset consists of 500 synthetic transaction records generated to simulate real-world purchasing behavior while maintaining data privacy. Transaction amounts were created using an exponential (skewed) distribution, ensuring that most transactions fall within lower to moderate values while a small number represent high-value purchases. This approach improves realism and meets the Task 1 requirement for non-uniform data generation.
For Task 2, descriptive statistics were computed for the Amount (USD) variable, including mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. The results indicate that the mean transaction amount is higher than the median, confirming a right-skewed distribution. This suggests that although most customers make relatively smaller purchases, a few large transactions significantly increase the average value. The standard deviation further highlights substantial variability in transaction amounts, which is typical in real transaction datasets.
To satisfy Task 3, the program calculates the average transaction amount for each region. The analysis shows noticeable differences across regions, with some regions exhibiting higher average spending than others. These variations may be influenced by regional economic factors or customer purchasing preferences. Additionally, a bar chart visualizing transaction counts per region provides insight into regional transaction volume and distribution.
For Task 4, the overall analysis demonstrates that the dataset successfully supports meaningful statistical and regional insights. While additional analyses such as scatter plots and correlation calculations are included for exploratory purposes, the core focus remains on fulfilling required tasks. In conclusion, this program addresses all earlier shortcomings by combining correct data generation, required visualizations, and comprehensive text-based interpretation, resulting in a complete and academically valid submission.
